# ChicagoFed_workshop

A workshop on scientific computing for economists with Python and Julia, to be
held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago in May 2016.  For details see [the
main workshop page](http://quantecon.org/chicago_fed_workshop.html).


### MyBinder Service

The MyBinder service launches a live programming environment in the Cloud and allows you to interact with the workshop notebooks. However the changes to these notebooks are **temporary** and do not persist next time you open the notebook. For these types of changes it is best to download the notebooks to your computer and run ``jupyter notebook`` in a terminal (or powershell in windows) in the folder that contains your notebook files. 

**Note:** This service currently only works for **python** notebooks.
